# Matriarcanopy

I see you all around me <br>
In the primroses and poppies that bloom <br>
And the verdant leaves in garden beds

I hear your voice in the song the birds sing <br>
In the whisper of the wind in the trees <br>
And the calming flow of the river stream

I feel your warmth in the morning light <br>
In the crackling embers by the fireside <br>
And the worn pages of my favorite book

I’ve felt so lost without you <br>
When I look at my Tree I see branches missing <br>
My Matriarchs no longer make up the canopy

Now when I look up searching for answers <br>
I see only the glaring Sun above <br>
And I miss the shelter you used to provide 

Though these new rays have inspired me <br>
Reminds me that it’s the light that lets you grow <br>
And I realize you weren’t the shade after all

I see you in the buzzing bees in wildflower meadows <br>
Hear your voice when I can’t find my words <br>
Feel your hands guiding me back when I’ve lost the path

And the times I need you the most now that you’re gone <br>
I remember you’re all around me <br>
You have been all along
