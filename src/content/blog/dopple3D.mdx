# The Dopple 3D Platform
At Dopple I was a founding Product Manager where I built and designed the Dopple 3D Platform with a small, seed-funded startup team. 
In addition to my Senior Product Manager role, I served as the Co-Product Designer.

## Platform Highlights

* Experience Designer workflow for setting up interactive elements, such as configurability, augmented reality, animations and cameras, and hotspots
* Virtual Studio for generating lifestyle imagery withg AI-generated scenes
* 3D Editor for Artists to manage all aspects of the 3D scene
* Live Preview with configuration and AR UI menus pre-generated
* Integration embed code generation for pre-set implementation
* Analytics Dashboards and Reports 
* Support for GLB and glTF and Khronos Material Extensions 
* Version Control and Whitelisting for A/B testing and full control over content distribution

Built to scale and serve both enterprise brands through SMBs, Users can organize their projects in various workspaces. Agencies especially took to organzing client's assets into segmented workspaces to keep IP and data clean.
