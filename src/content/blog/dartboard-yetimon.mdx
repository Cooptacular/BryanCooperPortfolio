# Custom Dartboard - Yeti Mon
![Cooparcade](../../assets/blogImg/woodworking/DartBoard-TheBridge.png)
I had always dreamed of making an arcade, and when the World shutdown in 2020 I had the chance to get in the woodshop with my dad and build The Cooparcade. This was one of my favorite projects I've ever worked on, from a sketch in my notebook to learning each step of the way to combine woodworking, software configuration, and electrical work.
